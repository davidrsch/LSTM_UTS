<p>How many neurons most have the LSTM layer?</p>
<p>With the goal of set how the structure of an ANN affects the results of a model and knowing that in this app the structure is unique, one LSTM layer and an output layer, several possibilities were stablished to the amount of neurons in the LSTM layer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same amount of neurons as inputs in the training vectors.</li>
<br>
<li>More used amount of neurons: 16, 32, 64, 128.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note:</i> The user can add more options.</p>
<p>The models will be compile in the same why as those shown in the aforrementioned works <a href = "https://rpubs.com/zkajdan/279967"> Time series forecasting - with deep learning </a> and <a href = "https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-timesteps-lstm-networks-time-series-forecasting/">How to use timesteps in LSTM networks for time series forecasting</a> using:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>The <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> optimizer.</li>
 <br>
 <li>The MSE loss function(MeanSquaredError of <a href = "https://keras.io/api/losses/regresssion_losses/">Regression losses</a>).</li>
