How many neurons most have the LSTM layer?

Determining the optimal number of neurons in an LSTM layer is crucial for the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The structure of an ANN significantly influences the model's results. In the context of an application with a unique structure comprising one LSTM layer followed by an output layer, various configurations for the number of neurons in the LSTM layer can be considered.

One approach is to match the number of neurons to the number of inputs in the training vectors. Alternatively, commonly utilized neuron counts such as 16, 32, 64, or 128 can be employed. It's important to note that these are not exhaustive options, and users have the flexibility to experiment with different quantities to tailor the network's complexity and capability to the specific task at hand. Ultimately, the choice of neuron count should align with the desired balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy.

The models will be compile in the same why as those shown in the aforrementioned works [Time series forecasting - with deep learning](https://rpubs.com/zkajdan/279967) and [How to use timesteps in LSTM networks for time series forecasting](https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-timesteps-lstm-networks-time-series-forecasting/) using:

-  The [Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8) optimizer.
-  The MSE loss function (MeanSquaredError of [Regression losses](https://keras.io/api/losses/regresssion_losses/)).
